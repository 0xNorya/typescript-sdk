Generate an Authorized Payload

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
generate(payload: AuthenticationPayloadInput): Promise<AuthorizedPayload>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  payload | AuthenticationPayloadInput | The configuration used to generate an authentication payload |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;AuthorizedPayload&gt;

- A payload authorized by the server that the client can sign for authentication

## Remarks

Generate a payload on the server side for a client side wallet to sign and use for authentication. This payload enables the server side wallet to specify exactly when the wallet is authorized to authenticate, and for which services they are able to access.

## Example


```javascript
const payload = {
  // The name of the server-side application authorizing the payload
  appication: "my-app-name",
  // The address of the client side wallet requesting to authenticate
  subject: "0x...",
  // The server-side endpoints the wallet is authorized to access (defaults to ["*"] for access to all)
  endpoints: ["endpoint1", "endpoint2"],
  // The date object representing the time before which the authentication is invalid (defaults to now)
  invalidBefore: new Date(),
  // The date object representing the time at which the authentication expires (5 hours from now)
  expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
}

const authorizedPayload = await sdk.auth.generate(payload)
```
