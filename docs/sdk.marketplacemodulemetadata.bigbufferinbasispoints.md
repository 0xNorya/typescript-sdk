## MarketplaceModuleMetadata.bigBufferInBasisPoints property

This is a percentage (e.g. 5%). A new bid is considered to be a winning bid only if its bid amount is at least the bid buffer (e.g. 5%) greater than the previous winning bid. This prevents buyers from making very slightly higher bids to win the auctioned items.

This value is formatter as basis points (e.g. 5% = 500).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
bigBufferInBasisPoints?: number | undefined;
```
